            "content": "In this post we will talk about optimizing a simple portfolio of cryptocurrency. The approaches below have been successfully applied to stock options trading and, as we see, work quite well for crypto. Also, crypto is great to learn and try modern trading strategies as you can get required historical currency data for free (we will show how below). In this post we do a simple portfolio composition and apply CVXP optimization to introduce library and methods and we will go into more complex Stochastic Discount Factor based strategies in the next post. . You are welcome to open our notebook on colab and see full working code, here we hide some technical parts. . Data Acquisition . The data for this exercise was obtained from the Binance API using the Python API client python-binance. While obtaining similar data for stock market would have been quite a task on its own (unless you work for a trading firm), in crypto worlds it is done easily. . An example of the data acquisition code: . Note: Install the module if needed using pip: &gt; #pip install python-binance . from binance.client import Client binance_api_key = &#39;YOUR-API-KEY&#39; binance_api_secret = &#39;YOUR-API-SECRET&#39; binance_client = Client(api_key=binance_api_key ,api_secret=binance_api_secret) klines = binance_client.get_historical_klines(symbol ,kline_size, date_from, date_to) data = pd.DataFrame(klines, columns = [COLUMNS]) . Following daily pairs was downloaded and formatted to pd DataFrame:BTCUSDT; ETHUSDT; BNBUSDT; LTCUSDT. For each timepoint, Binance provides conventional OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and Volume data. In this exercise, we used only the Close column. One might consider the combination of all five values and come up with a different (and potentially more reliable) metric, for example: the weighted average price. We will limit to the basic one for the sake of simplicity . The data is loaded and transformed . fuldf = (pd.read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h17/fastreport/master/data/cryptosdf/data.csv&#39;,parse_dates=[&#39;timestamp&#39;]) .set_index(&#39;timestamp&#39;) ) y_label = fuldf.columns[0] factors = (fuldf .columns .tolist() ) total_size = fuldf.shape[0] train_set = .8 train_id = int( total_size * train_set) df_train = fuldf.iloc[:train_id] df_test = fuldf.iloc[train_id:] split_index = fuldf.iloc[train_id].name . The joint time-series of four crypto assets looks the following: . df_train.head() . BTCUSDT ETHUSDT BNBUSDT LTCUSDT . timestamp . 2017-12-13 16033.29 | 683.99 | 2.7190 | 290.01 | . 2017-12-14 16334.98 | 679.76 | 3.1519 | 272.40 | . 2017-12-15 17539.83 | 674.95 | 4.1200 | 294.00 | . 2017-12-16 19102.66 | 682.81 | 4.6378 | 293.97 | . 2017-12-17 18860.02 | 707.64 | 5.9990 | 311.40 | . Each trading pair has a different amount of data available: The oldest tradable crypto instruments on Binance are BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT - data points are available from 2017-08-17. For BNBUSDT and LTCUSDT first trading days are 2017-11-06 and 2017-12-13, respectively. . We joined these time series together on the earliest common trading date: 2017-12-13 up to 2021-06-14. The full joint dataset size is equal to 1280 samples. . In order to properly train the model, We split the dataset into training and testing sets at 2020-10-02. . Training interval: 2017-12-13 to 2020-10-02 (1024 data points). . Below is the joint plot of the full dataset in the logarithmic scale. The dotted line represents the train-test split at 2020-10-02 . plot_data =np.log(fuldf) fig , ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,7)) plot_data.plot(ax=ax,alpha=0.8) ax.legend(loc=0) ax.set(title=&#39;Assets&#39;,xlabel=&#39;Date&#39;,ylabel=&#39;price, log scale&#39;); ax.axvline(split_index,color=&#39;grey&#39;, linestyle=&#39;--&#39;, lw=2); . #Transform raw data to log-return format: lret_data = np.log1p(df_train.pct_change()).dropna(axis=0,how=&#39;any&#39;) . II. Data Transformation . In order to be properly trained, input time series has to be transfored into the log-return format: . $r_t = ln{ frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}}$ . Where $P_t$ is a price of the asset at time $t$. . The model needs vector $I$ to perform the optimization: . $ I = begin{pmatrix} r_{0,0} &amp; dots &amp; r_{0,l} vdots &amp; &amp; vdots r_{t-1,0} &amp; dots &amp; r_{t-1,l} end{pmatrix} $ . Where $l$ is the number of features in the model. . I = (lret_data[factors].iloc[1:].values) print(I.shape,&#39; n&#39;,I[:10,:]) .

Model . Our goal is to explain the differences in the cross-section of returns $R$ for individual stocks. . Let $I$ denote the return of crypto assets at time $t$. We try to obtain weights $w$ that minimize risk given fixed return. The portfolio return $R$ can be expressed as follows: . $R = r^Tw$ . For this model portfolio, we target a 100% return, which is quite expected in the crypto world. We will only model investments held for one period. . The problem can be expressed as: . begin{array}{ll} mbox{minimize} &amp; sum||I w ||^2 mbox{subject to} &amp; { bf 1}^T w = 1, 1^TR=1 end{array}Since the above problem is convex, we can estimate the $w$ for the model portfolio using the cvxpy framework. . Note: in reality, you want to get maximum return given fixed risk, but due to the way CVXP and semi-linear programming is setup, this formulation does not follow Disciplined Convex Programming rules (see https://dcp.stanford.edu/), so we use the former formulation as it is equivalent. Also, you might need fix return and low risk models depending on type of business your are in and your risk appetite. . #define weights w = cp.Variable(shape=(I.shape[1] ,1),nonneg=True) #Define expression R = I @ w #Construct the problem prob = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize( cp.norm(R) ) , [ cp.sum(R) == 1 ,cp.sum(w) == 1 ] ) prob.solve(verbose=True) print(&#39;weights for the model: n&#39;,dict(zip(factors,w.value))) .

            "title": "The Rainbow Method Part I. Encoding Categorical Variables.",
            "content": ". Introduction . &quot;I have 2000 features and I need to get to 50 features and keep model as good or better&quot; was how this all started. This is familiar to anyone in institutional data science where you need to carefully vet every model and look at each feature to make sure it is fine from the standpoint of regulation. What is valuable about this story is that it is based on a real production model that was developed by Anna Arakelyan at MassMutual and a method suggested by Dmytro Karabash. We will get to detailed results at the end but here&#39;s a preview results for anyone who want to take a peak: . The rainbow method outperforms the One-hot easily. In fact, the rainbow method even shows better result for 50 features than One-hot does for 100. Also note that when droping from 50 to 10 features, the reduction in macro-f1 if you use One-hot is 6 times that of the rainbow method (3 times for kappa and accuracy, 2 times for macro-auc). . Both models actually keep improving as the number of features goes up. Though the improvement is substantially faster and bigger for the rainbow method. . Background . Data encoding is the crucial part of any data science pipeline. No matter which machine learning algorithm is used - there is no avoiding of data cleaning and encoding. Especially with dirty and complex real data sets, ensuring the most appropriate and efficient way of feature encoding and engineering is a nontrivial problem. While encoding quantitative and binary columns is usually a straightforward task, the encoding of categorical variables deserves a deeper look. One of the most popular encoding methods for categorical variables has been the One-hot procedure. It generates an indicator variable for every category and, thus, creates a set of K new features, where K is the number of categories. One significant implication of this method is the dimensionality increase. Depending on the magnitude of K, it can have various undesirable technical consequences: substantial raise of computational complexity, loss of degrees of freedom (N-K, where N is the number of samples), multicollinearity, and, ultimately, an overfitted model. Non-technical consequences include unnecessary complication of the model that should be communicated to final users and that contradict the law of parsimony aka Occam&#39;s razor. . Method . We call it rainbow from a very simple analogy: if you have a categorical feature with names &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Indigo&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot;, in other words - colors of the rainbow, instead of one hot encoding, you can simply create one feature with encoding: . . 0 = &quot;Red&quot; 1 = &quot;Orange&quot; 2 = &quot;Yellow&quot; 3 = &quot;Green&quot; 4 = &quot;Blue&quot; 5 = &quot;Indigo&quot; 6 = &quot;Violet&quot; . This would replace seven One-hot features with one rainbow. . Most of the nominal variables, from the first glance, seem like they cannot be converted to a quantitative scale. This is where we suggest finding a rainbow. The seemingly unordered categories acquire a perfect order if we find a scale, where each category fits into its own unique place. With the color - the natural scale is Hue. But it is not the only one. We can think of, say, brightness, saturation, color temperature, etc. We invite you to experiment with a few different rainbows that might capture different nuances of the categorical quality. . You can actually make and use two or more rainbows out of one categorical variable depending on the number of categories K and the context. . We don&#39;t recommend to use much more than $ log_2 {K}$. The reason we suggest not to use more than $ log_2 K$ rainbows is not to surpass a number of encodings in what is called binary-One-hot-encoding. One easy way to create $ log_2 K$ out of any rainbow is by rotating binary digits of your first rainbow; note rotating not permuting as if you would permute you would get $( log_2 K)!$ which is greater than K for K&gt;8. . Why is rainbow better than any other choice? It is very simple and intuitively sensible. In many cases it is not even that important which rainbow you choose (and by that we mean the color order), it would still be better than using One-hot. The more natural orders are just likely to be slightly better than others and easier to remember. . Hence our motto:&quot;When a nature gives you a rainbow, take it...&quot; . Important note here: this method is highly efficient in conjunction with the models that rely on variables as ranks rather than exact values. For example, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting - these algorithms will output the same result if, say, the variable Number of Children is coded as . . 0 = &quot;0 Children&quot; 1 = &quot;1 Child&quot; 2 = &quot;2 Children&quot; 3 = &quot;3 Children&quot; 4 = &quot;4 or more Children&quot; . or as . . 1 = &quot;0 Children&quot; 2 = &quot;1 Child&quot; 3 = &quot;2 Children&quot; 4 = &quot;3 Children&quot; 5 = &quot;4 or more Children&quot; . or even as . . -100 = &quot;0 Children&quot; -85 = &quot;1 Child&quot; 0 = &quot;2 Children&quot; 10 = &quot;3 Children&quot; 44 = &quot;4 or more Children&quot; . as long as the correct order of the categories is preserved. The values themselves don&#39;t carry the quantitative role in these algorithms. It is the rank of the variable that matters, and a tree-based algorithm will use its magic to make the most appropriate splits to introduce new tree nodes. . The application of our method for other algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression is out of scope of this article. We expect that such way of feature engineering would be still beneficial, but that is a subject of a different investigation. . Note that by using a rainbow rather than One-hot we are not losing any of the signal. Let&#39;s consider two scenarios. First, if the categories are wildly different, and each one introduces a substantial gain to the model, the algorithm such as xgboost will just make the splits between all the values which is perfectly equivalent to One-hot. Second, if the chosen rainbow order is the least favorable, once again, the algorithm will make all the necessary splits. However, if the rainbow order is even somewhat meaningful, the algorithm would capture the similarity in the adjacent values by making a smart decision about the number and location of splits. For example, it will decide if some of the adjacent values should be clustered together, or separated. This will save us dimensionality without any informational loss. . Examples . The application of our method depends highly on the level of measurement of the treated variables. While quantitative variables have a ratio scale, i.e. they have a meaningful 0, ordered values, and equal distances between values; categorical variables usually have either interval, or ordinal, or nominal scales. Let us illustrate our method for each of these types of categorical variables. . Interval variables have ordered values, equal distances between values, but the value itself is not necessarily meaningful, for example, 0 does not indicate an absence of a quality. The common examples of interval variables are Likert scales: . . How likely is the person to buy a smartphone mobile phone? 1 = &quot;Very Unlikely&quot; 2 = &quot;Somewhat Unlikely&quot; 3 = &quot;Neither Likely, Nor Unlikely&quot; 4 = &quot;Somewhat Likely&quot; 5 = &quot;Very Likely&quot; . In a straightforward way, if we simply use the raw values 1 through 5, that will save us dimensionality without losing a single bit of information. The algorithm such as xgboost will make the appropriate splits instead of being forced to use the splits predetermined by One-hot, which in many cases is simply an overfit. . Ordinal variables have ordered values that are meaningless, and the distances between values are also not equal or not even explainable. An example: . . What is the highest level of Education completed by the person? 1 = &quot;No High School&quot; 2 = &quot;High School&quot; 3 = &quot;Associate Degree&quot; 4 = &quot;Bachelor&#39;s Degree&quot; 5 = &quot;Master&#39;s Degree&quot; 6 = &quot;Doctoral Degree&quot; . Similar to interval variables, raw ordinal numeric codes can be used in the model without introducing any issues, as long as the order is correct. In some cases, a variable is intrinsically ordinal, but the given numeric codes don&#39;t follow the correct order - in these situations we could simply reorder categories and then use this updated variable as a quantitative feature. . The use of natural rainbow for interval and ordinal variables is likely not the cause for concern because it is clearly a perfect alternative to One-hot for tree-based algorithms. The more complicated and non-obvious question is how to treat nominal variables. . Nominal variables have no obvious order between categories, and are almost always encoded with One-hot method. This is where finding a rainbow becomes valuable, turning something, that seems completely non quantitative, into a quantitative scale. In this way, a nominal variable Color . . A = &quot;Red&quot; B = &quot;Blue&quot; C = &quot;Green&quot; D = &quot;Yellow&quot; . is replaced by the newly engineered rainbow feature . . 1 = &quot;Blue&quot; 2 = &quot;Green&quot; 3 = &quot;Yellow&quot; 4 = &quot;Red&quot; . Lets us show a few other examples of creating rainbows. . . Vehicle Type C = &quot;Compact Car&quot; F = &quot;Full-size Car&quot; L = &quot;Luxury Car&quot; M = &quot;Mid-Size Car&quot; P = &quot;Pickup Truck&quot; S = &quot;Sports Car&quot; U = &quot;SUV&quot; V = &quot;Van&quot; . For this variable we can think of dozens of characteristics to make a rainbow - vehicle size, capacity, price category, average speed, fuel economy, costs of ownership, motor features, etc. Which one (or more than one) to pick? The choice depends on the context of the model and what are you trying to predict. The preference should be given to the ones that provide more explanatory power and/or make sense from the interpretation standpoint. . Consider another variable: . . Marital Status A = &quot;Married&quot; B = &quot;Single&quot; C = &quot;Inferred Married&quot; D = &quot;Inferred Single&quot; . If we think about Single and Married as the two ends of the spectrum, then Inferred Single could be between the two ends, closer to Single, while Inferred Married would be between the two ends, closer to Married. That would make sense because Inferred holds certain degree of uncertainty. Thus, the following order would be reasonable: . . 1 = &quot;Single&quot; 2 = &quot;Inferred Single&quot; 3 = &quot;Inferred Married&quot; 4 = &quot;Married&quot; . In case there are any missing values here, the Unknown category fits exactly in the middle between Single and Married as there is no reason to prefer one end over the other. So the modified scale could look like this: . . 1 = &quot;Single&quot; 2 = &quot;Inferred Single&quot; 3 = &quot;Unknown&quot; 3 = &quot;Inferred Married&quot; 4 = &quot;Married&quot; . Another example: . . Occupation 1 = &quot;Professional/Technical&quot; 2 = &quot;Administration/Managerial&quot; 3 = &quot;Sales/Service&quot; 4 = &quot;Clerical/White Collar&quot; 5 = &quot;Craftsman/Blue Collar&quot; 6 = &quot;Student&quot; 7 = &quot;Homemaker&quot; 8 = &quot;Retired&quot; 9 = &quot;Farmer&quot; A = &quot;Military&quot; B = &quot;Religious&quot; C = &quot;Self Employed&quot; D = &quot;Other&quot; . Finding a rainbow here might be harder, but here are a few ways to do it: we could order occupations by average annual salary, by its prevalence in the geographic area of interest, or by information from some other dataset. That might involve calling a Census API or some other data source, and might be complicated by the fact that these values are not static, but these are still viable solutions. . What if there is no natural rainbow? . In some situations though we cannot find a logical order for the rainbow because the variable itself is not interpretable. An example could be a black box column made by a third party: . . Financial Cluster of the Household 1 = &quot;Market Watchers&quot; 2 = &quot;Conservative Wealth&quot; 3 = &quot;Specific Savers&quot; 4 = &quot;Tried and True&quot; 5 = &quot;Trendy Inclinations&quot; 6 = &quot;Current Consumers&quot; 7 = &quot;Rural Trust&quot; 8 = &quot;City Spotlight&quot; 9 = &quot;Career Conscious&quot; 10 = &quot;Digital Financiers&quot; 11 = &quot;Financial Futures&quot; 12 = &quot;Stable Influentials&quot; 13 = &quot;Conservatively Rural&quot; . In this case we might not have a clear idea how to order categories due to lack of knowledge of what each category entails. What to do with such variables? . We recommend creating an artificial rainbow by looking at how each category is related to the target variable. . The simplest solution is to place categories in the order of correlation with target variable. So the category with the highest value of correlation with the dependent variable would acquire numeric code 1, and the category with the lowest correlation would acquire numeric code 13. So our rainbow in this case would mean the relationship between the cluster and the target variable. This method would work for both - classification and regression models - as it can be applied to discrete and to continuous target variable. . Alternatively, you can construct your own rainbows by merely utilizing certain statistical qualities of the categorical variable and the target variable. . For instance, in case of a binary target variable, and we could look at the proportion of ones given each of the categories. Suppose, among Market Watchers percent of positive targets is 0.67, while for Conservative Wealth it is 0.45. In that case, Market Watchers will be ordered higher than Conservative Wealth (or lower, if the target percent scale is ascending). In other words, this rainbow would reflect the prevalence of positive target inside each category. . In case of multiclass classification, we could create rainbows for each class to represent relationship between categories and each class separately. . In Part I, we introduced you to the Rainbow method. In Part II we provide an empirical example of its application and demonstrate its superiority over One-hot using the real data project developed at MassMutual. In Part III, we provide theoretical justification for the method. . The Rainbow Method Part II. Application to a Real Data Science Problem . We will illustrate the effectiveness of the rainbow encoding method using the real data science project developed in the Customer Journey domain of Data Science at MassMutual - a life insurance company with a 170 years of history which takes pride in growing a large team of data scientists, engineers, and technologists to support most of the business decisions. . Business Use Case . In a nutshell, the data task is a multiclass classification problem that aims to predict one of the five Mindset Segments for each of the prospective customers. . . The segmentation framework represents five classes that reflect a person&#39;s age, financial stability, and attitude towards financial decisions. The predicted segments are then used by MassMutual marketing team in different types of campaigns for targeting and customization. For example, Self-Assured customers would value more independence and autonomy in making decision of buying a life insurance policy whereas Day to Day customers would value having a guidance and thorough explanations of different financial products by a dedicated advisor. . We have a small set of labeled indivuduals (17.5K persons). The labels are provided by the MassMutual vendor which ran Mindset surveys and designed segment assignment rules. For simplicity, let&#39;s assume we know nothing about these rules and take labels as given. . Then we attach the columns from our main prospect database to these 17.5K persons. The goal is to learn the best model using these target labels and the available features, and then predict segments for all other (unlabelled) prospective customers. . The main database for this problem is provided by Acxiom and covers about 300 columns representing rich set of demographic characteristics, composition of the household, income and net worth, financial behavior, and digital savvyness. . Using Acxiom data and the Mindset Segmentation problem, we will compare the conventional One-hot encoding with the Rainbow method. For this 5-class classification task, we will demonstrate a few standard metrics - Accuracy, Cohen&#39;s Kappa, Macro Avg F1 score, Macro Avg AUC ROC. . Cohen&#39;s Kappa, F1 and AUC ROC are very helpful for an unbalanced multiclass classification problem. Accuracy is not the best metric for such task, and is used merely for interpretation and comparison purposes. . Categorical Variables . We took all the existing categorical variables in Acxiom database - interval, ordinal, and nominal, and excluded quantitative and binary variables. The idea was to show the pure difference in the model performance between the two types of encoding for the same set of catogorical factors. . We then applied a target stratified 4-fold Cross Validation split. All the data processing from this point on is done inside the cross validation loop, i.e. the creation of One-hot features and Rainbow features is learned from each fold train set and applied to each fold validation set. . The total set of 111 variables was transformed into 201 Rainbow features and, alternatively, into 2260 One-hot features (with very slight deviations in N in 4 different folds). . Type of variable N raw N Rainbow encoded N One-hot encoded . Interval | 64 | 64 | 1670 | . Ordinal | 14 | 14 | 178 | . Nominal | 33 | 123 | 412 | . Total | 111 | 201 | 2260 | . While interval and ordinal variables have a straightforward rainbow tranformation - one can notice that 64 interval features turned into 64 rainbows and 14 ordinal features turned into 14 rainbows, the nominal variables tranformation was a bit more involved. Out of 33 nominal variables, for 23 we found a natural rainbow, while for 10 remaining variables we applied correlation ordering and target percent ordering (see Part 1). Since we deal with 5 classes, we made 10 new features for each of these variables. . For example, given the name of feature &quot;Financial_Cluster&quot; and 5 segment names, we made features . Financial_Cluster_Self-Assured_correlation_rank | Financial_Cluster_Juggler_correlation_rank | Financial_Cluster_Starter_correlation_rank | Financial_Cluster_Day to Day_correlation_rank | Financial_Cluster_Well-Establishes_correlation_rank and | Financial_Cluster_Self-Assured_target_percent | Financial_Cluster_Juggler_target_percent | Financial_Cluster_Starter_target_percent | Financial_Cluster_Day to Day_target_percent | Financial_Cluster_Well-Establishes_target_percent | . In this way, 33 raw nominal variables turned into 123 Rainbows. . It is important to note that the search for natural or non-natural Rainbows is highly project and context specific, and is more of an art than a craft. For instance, for a binary classification problem, there probably would have been only one or two Rainbows. . We ran all XGBoost models covering this hyperparameter space: . &#39;objective&#39;: &#39;multi:softprob&#39; &#39;eval_metric&#39;: &#39;mlogloss&#39; &#39;num_class&#39;: 5 &#39;subsample&#39;: 0.8 &#39;max_depth&#39;: [2, 3, 5] &#39;eta&#39;: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5] &#39;n_estimators&#39;: [50, 100, 200] . All the results below in this article represent cross validation average metrics. . Aggregate Results . Let us start with overall averages for all runs. Clearly, the average metrics across all models are notably higher for Rainbow encoding. . Hyperparameters . The following plots show dynamic of metrics depending on every hyperparameter keeping other hyperparameters constant. These plots also clearly demonstrate the superiority of Rainbow method for every hyperparameter and every metric. . Runtime . Next, let&#39;s compare the runtime for each method. . One-hot: 66.074 s Rainbow: 7.444 s . Average time to run a single rainbow model is 9 times faster that of the single One-hot model! So, in addition to a substantial increase in model performance metrics, Rainbow method can also save data scientists huge amount of time. . Interval, Ordinal, and Nominal . Next, we ran the models that covered the bundles of interval, ordinal, and nominal features separately. Below are the results. . macro-f1 kappa macro-auc accuracy . feature group method . interval One-hot 0.2965 | 0.1563 | 0.6849 | 0.4003 | . Rainbow 0.3275 | 0.1894 | 0.7040 | 0.4149 | . ordinal One-hot 0.2362 | 0.1113 | 0.6338 | 0.3784 | . Rainbow 0.2500 | 0.1247 | 0.6385 | 0.3827 | . nominal One-hot 0.2916 | 0.1542 | 0.6783 | 0.3938 | . Rainbow 0.2940 | 0.1544 | 0.6729 | 0.3915 | . These results demonstrate again that Rainbow is preferred to One-hot. As expected, interval and ordinal features gain the most from Rainbow encoding, while nominal variables - less so. . Feature Selection . Finally, to make a comparison more fair in terms of dimensionality, we picked top 10, top 50, and top 100 features from each feature set - Rainbow and One-hot. We used feature importance attribute of the XGBoost model and aggregated feature importance scores for 4 cross validation folds on the best hyperparameter set for each encoding type. Below are the results. . macro-f1 kappa macro-auc accuracy . number of features method . 10 One-hot 0.2685 | 0.1505 | 0.6778 | 0.3945 | . Rainbow 0.3273 | 0.1898 | 0.7010 | 0.4122 | . 50 One-hot 0.3342 | 0.1975 | 0.7040 | 0.4180 | . Rainbow 0.3428 | 0.2070 | 0.7092 | 0.4240 | . 100 One-hot 0.3333 | 0.1992 | 0.7102 | 0.4205 | . Rainbow 0.3477 | 0.2105 | 0.7130 | 0.4245 | . Every single metric is considerably higher for the Rainbow method, especially with the lower number of selected features. As mentioned in Part 1, rainbow encoding with 50 features is even better than One-hot with 100 features as shown by macro-f1, kappa, and accuracy. Also, note the drop from 50 to 10 features in One-hot versus rainbow - macro-f1 looses 0.0657 points with One-hot compared to only 0.0155 points with Rainbow. . Conclusion . As we illustrated above, the Rainbow method is an elegant and simple way to encode categorical variables, that will significantly reduce data dimensionality without losing any part of valuable signal; that will likely cause substantial improvements in model performance metrics (or, at the very least, will not cause any reductions in metrics); and that will save great amount of time for modelers. . Finally, we should note that this article just opens the conversation about the Rainbow method, and by no means exhausts the topic. In the potential future investigations, we could explore some other aspects. To name a few: binary and continuous target variables; comparison with other dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA; missing values and how they fit the Rainbow framework; limits and implications of combining seemingly unrelated features into a single Rainbow. We hope to open the gate for further questions and feedback on this method. . The Rainbow Method Part III. Conditional Mathematical Foundation . Framework . Aside from reducing number of variables which was our main goal, we would also like to understand why do rainbows produce better results. . We wouldn&#39;t completely satisfy Einstein here, but base our foundation on assumption that pruning of the trees that maximize unregularized log-loss producing supperior values. In fact regulariation of trees, pruning of trees and various early stopping rules are all trying to achieve the same goal, which is often summarized in &quot;avoid overfit&quot;, yet let us examine what that really means in our case by case basis. . Imagine you have K categories for each the optimal values to be added to the nodes are 1, 2, ..., K in some order not necessarily random. If that was the case both on-hot encoding and rainbow method would require K-1 comparisons. We have a tie. That would be the case where all categories should be distinquished with different values at the end-nodes, which is rarely the case. . To make things simple lets now assume we have 4 features and the optimal values at the end nodes are 1, 1.01, 2, 2.01 Assume further that $ epsilon$ 0.01 is low enough so that the first and second pair of of categories should not be distinguished (or the nodes that distinguished should be pruned). . That is the whole definition of &quot;avoid overfit&quot;, the point here is that at some point signal to uncertainty ratio is to low to make a distinction and that is why xgboost has at least 7 hyperparameters that should help in not distinquishing these pairs: max_depth, gamma, min_child_weight, lambda, alpha, min_split_loss, max_leaves . Definitions of these hyperparameters can be found here https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html . Now to explaination how each one of these would prevent between split of first and second categories: . Hyperparameters that help to avoid overfit. . Taking the above 1, 1.01, 2, 2.01 example let us look at how each of these 7 hyp . max_depth: disallows too many splits so that on each split only best splits would be chosen, so given your max_depth&lt;K-2, you would not get to split the first and second category into different branches (those a next tree might). . | gamma, if this one is $&lt;0.01$, it would not split as the difference is smaller than gamma. . | min_child_weight, if each category has less children that min_child_weight it would not split down to one category, . | lambda: these will help not assign the tree that does split a very small weight . | alpha: similar as lambda . | min_split_loss: similar to gamma except it would truncate later . | max_leaves: similar to max_depth . | Mathematical analysis: How exactly does rainbow help? . Below we would show that rainbow always outperforms One-hot in best, average and worst case scenarios! The discussion below applies to any tree based algorithm that relies only on order of values which include: xgboost or any gradient boosted trees or any random forest. . We first demonstrate this with a simple example, then we proceed with full generalization and simulation. . Examples . Simplest Example . Consider the following example: . assume a binary classification problem, with output variable having values 0 and 1 | assume only one categorical variable | assume exactly four categoties with values v1 &lt; v2 &lt; v3 &lt; v4, say with a number of samples in each value | assume an ideal separation will give (v1 and v2) samples score 1 and to (v3 anv v4) samples score 2, where score is some decision function used for separation (e.g. Gini, impurity, etc.) | . If we want to build a single decision tree, then . in the case of rainbow: two samples will be sent to the left branch and two other samples will be sent to the right branch of the tree. (diagram) In such a situation a natural split occurs between v2 and v3, and rainbow would need one split . | while One-hot would need two or three splits. (diagram) . | . Generalizing simple example. . Let&#39;s look at more general case, where the values of the categorical variable are in different order. . The number of splits would depend on the order in which these categories appear . For rainbow orders: . 1,1,2,2 and 2,2,1,1 the number of splits would be 1; (1,1,2,2) is an example above. . | 1,2,2,1 and 2,1,1,2 the number of splits would require 2 . | and 1,2,1,2 and 2,1,2,1, the number of splits would require 3 . | . One-hot would be similar except it would be the order in which the one-hot split happens: . 1,1,2,2 and 2,2,1,1 the number of splits would be 2; . | and 1,2,2,1 and 2,1,1,2 and 1,2,1,2 and 2,1,2,1 the number of splits would be 3 . | . Note that these are not the same orders so we cannot say that rainbow better in each case as order at the top (in which categories appear in rainbow) is not the same order at the bottom (in which categories get split by one-hot). However we see that on average rainbow is better as it gives best case 1, average 2, worst case 3; while one hot gives best case 2, average $ frac 83$ and worst 3. In fact we would see that this is true in general. . For One-hot, assume rainbow selection of the next choice. . subsample col | subsample rows | not all splits considered, rather some approximation even on a single scale | counts of samples in each value can be highly uneven - this worse for one-hot . | assume inside one var all splits are considered, but not across all vars . | . General Case: Random rainbow vs one-hot . Assume we have $K$ categories that optimally would need to be split into groups of size $G_1,G_2,...,G_g$. By size we mean number of categories out of K, not the number of samples. In simple example above $K=4$, $g=2$ and $G_1=2$ consisted of {v_1,v_2} and $G_2=2$ of {v_3,v_4}. Since our rainbow is random, the K categories would appear in random order, however for the purposes of computation only their corresponding group would matter and this is the order that we would always talk about when dealing with rainbow. (means that v1, v2 is same as v2, v1) . For one-hot the order that would matter is the one in which one-hot splits are made and this is also assume to be random. This is the order that we would always refer to when talking about one-hot. . In reality the one-hot splits are not fully random and varies from the number of samples in each category, subsamples of columns that chosen and other hyperparameters. That can have both negative and positive effect on one-hot but will make analysis much more difficult. . While the orders that matter for rainbow and one-hot are not the same it helps to couple them to make comparisons. . It is time to compute best, average and worst cases. (Let&#39;s compare) . Best case: One-hot . We want to make that the biggest groups won&#39;t be split. . In best case one-hot would require $K - G_{max}$ splits, where $G_{max} = max_i G_i$ is the maximum of $G_i$. The best case $K - G_{max}$ is obtained when each group except the largest one gets one split per category and the remaining largest group has the same answer so doesn&#39;t require any additional splits. To prove that one cannot do better observe that if we do not make a split for two categories in distinct groups than there is no way to distinguish the values in these two categories. . Best case: Random Rainbow . In best case one-hot rainbow would require $g-1$ splits . which happens when groups are together and it simply splits at $g-1$ points to separate $g$ groups. One cannot do better as if there is no split in between two groups there is . no way to distinquish them. . Clearly $$K - G_{max}=( sum_{i=1}^g G_i)-G_{max}=( sum_{i!=max} G_i) geq ( sum_{i!=max} 1) = g-1$$ and hence rainbow is better in best case. . Average Case: One-hot . . Note: From the same logic as presented in best case follows that: &gt; 1. the number of splits that one-hot would need is the number $N$ of categories that are chosen before remaining ones are in one group. . the number of splits that rainbow need would always be $D$, number of consequitive pairs in rainbow order that are in distinct groups. In the best case N = K- Gmax, D=g-1. | It is easiest to compute probability that $N = K-R$ for $R$ ranging from $1$ to $K$, where R representing the size of the last group in the order (so if the order in which one-hot variable corresponding to categories are chosen is for example 112233222, the R=3, since the last group 222 is of size 3). . begin{align} mathbb E[N] &amp;= mathbb E[K-R] = K- mathbb E[R] = K - sum_{j=1}^{ infty} mathbb P[R geq j] =K- sum_{j=1}^K frac{ sum_i frac{G_i!}{(G_i-j)!}} { frac{K!}{(K-j)!}} = (K-1) - sum_{j=2}^K frac{ sum_i frac{G_i!}{(G_i-j)!}} { frac{K!}{(K-j)!}} end{align} Average Case: Rainbow . For rainbow the average case is $ mathbb E[D]$ where $D$ is number of consequitive pairs in rainbow order that are in distinct groups. . begin{align} mathbb E[D] &amp;= (K - 1) cdot (1- frac{ sum_i G_i cdot (G_i-1)} {K(K-1)}) notag &amp;= (K-1)- frac{ sum G_i cdot (G_i-1)} {K} notag end{align}An easy way to see that this value is larger, is the stochastic coupling, since both $N$ and $D$ can be obtained as starting from $K$ and subtracting $-1$ for each consequitive pair in the same group; except in case of $N$ all these pairs have to be in string at the end. Due to this restriction $N$ is always larger. . Worst Case: One-hot . Worst case for one-hot is $K-1$ when one goes through all but one category to get to one group remaining. . Worst Case: Rainbow . In this case it is $ min( (K - 1), 2 cdot (K-G_{max}))$ as we can only get upto two splits per each category not in the largest group. Clearly this is also less than or equal to one-hot. . Less splits is the main argument, less splits means less time and comput resources. How this mean less overfit? Less time and less work means work if more effective. . Simulation . We also present a simulation for a few examples. . #collapse_input import pandas as pd from collections import Counter import numpy as np s=&#39;12,112,1112,1122,11112,11122,111222,11123,11223,112233,11223344,111222333,1111122233,1111111122,1111111123&#39; #s+=&#39;,&#39;+(&#39;1&#39;*10+&#39;2&#39;*10)+&#39;,&#39;+(&#39;1&#39;*20+&#39;2&#39;*20) cc=examples=s.split(&#39;,&#39;) examples=[list(i) for i in examples] # number of splits in each scenario o_best = [len(e)-max(Counter(e).values()) for e in examples] r_best = [len(Counter(e))-1 for e in examples] o_worst = [len(e)-1 for e in examples] r_worst = [min(len(e)-1,2*(len(e)-max(Counter(e).values()))) for e in examples] o_ave = [] r_ave = [] n_samples = 40000 # to have two precision digits for e in examples: # o_sum and r_sum is the sum of number of splits over all samples # we want to get average n of splits given various scenarios (avg over samples) o_sum = r_sum = 0 for i in range(n_samples): p = np.random.permutation(e) #[::-1] omiting as same thing but to indicate we count from end for one-how order o_res = r_res = len(e)-1 for i in range(len(p)-1): if p[i]==p[i+1]: r_res -=1 for i in range(len(p)-1): if p[i]==p[i+1]: o_res -=1 else: break o_sum += o_res r_sum += r_res o_ave += [o_sum/n_samples] r_ave += [r_sum/n_samples] ii = &#39;o_best,r_best,o_ave,r_ave,o_worst,r_worst&#39;.replace(&#39;o_&#39;,&#39;One-hot &#39;).replace(&#39;r_&#39;,&#39;Rainbow &#39;) ii = ii.replace(&#39;ave&#39;,&#39;Average&#39;).replace(&#39;best&#39;,&#39;Best&#39;).replace(&#39;worst&#39;,&#39;Worst&#39;) ii = ii.split(&#39;,&#39;) ii = [i+&#39; Case&#39; for i in ii] rainbow_vs_onehot=pd.DataFrame([o_best,r_best,o_ave,r_ave,o_worst,r_worst],columns=cc,index=ii).round(2) rainbow_vs_onehot=rainbow_vs_onehot.iloc[[4,5,2,3,0,1]] rainbow_vs_onehot.T.plot(rot=45,figsize=(16,10)) rainbow_vs_onehot . 12 112 1112 1122 11112 11122 111222 11123 11223 112233 11223344 111222333 1111122233 1111111122 1111111123 .

Remove from the article, even from the appendix. . | from me, understand it all and rewrite in human language . | don&#39;t want to talk about hyperparameters . | . Bonus: How many random rainbows do you need to outperform best-case One-hot? . Let&#39;s ask one last question that does not pose theoretical significance. How many random rainbows would it take to outperform best-case one-hot? . Let us call this number of rainbows $R$ and assume it is not too large, then corresponding $D$ can on average be begin{align} mathbb E[D] &amp; = (K - 1) * (1- frac{ sum_i G_i*(G_i-1)} {K(K-1)})^R notag &amp; approx (K-1)- R* frac{ sum G_i*(G_i-1)} {K} tag{4} end{align} . So from (1) we get that. . $$ mathbb E[D] leq K-G_{max}$$ if we let $R$ be greater than $ frac{G_{max}}{G_i}$ for all $i$ or in other words if: $$ R geq frac{G_{max}}{G_{min}} $$ This is of course less than $G_{max}$. Similar computatoin can also show that it also has to be less than $g$, but then from $g*G_{max} leq K$ we can show that $R leq sqrt{K}$. In fact with a bit more detailed calculation one can show $R lessapprox frac { sqrt{K}}{2}$ as $K$ gets larger and this actually would imply that $R$ is not too large in the approximation we used above. . Hence we showed that single perfect rainbow outperforms, $K$ One-hot encoding and that $ frac{ sqrt{K}}{2}$ random rainbows would outperform $K$ One-hot encodings. .

Sound identification is one of our instincts that kept human beings safe. Sounds play a significant role in our life, Starting from recognizing a predator nearby to being inspired by music, to lots of human voices, to the cry of a bird. Therefore, developing audio classifiers is a crucial task in our lives. . In many cases, it is crucial to classify the source of the sounds and is already widely used for various purposes. In music, there&#39;s a classifier for the genre of music. Recently similar systems started to be used to classify bird calls, something that historically was done by a profession called Ornithologists. Their goal is to categorize which sounds of birds because it is difficult to detect the birdcalls from the fields or noisy environments. . Recently, deep learning (DL) has become one of the popular technologies to solve lots of tasks in our lives due to its accuracy, along with the improvement of computational devices like CPU (Central Processing Unit), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). The below chart shows how big the deep learning market is and the expected size of its future from the aspects of the software, hardware, and services. . . Fig 2. Deep Learning market of U.S. from 2014 to 2025 . In this post, We will take the task of reading an audio file with zero to few bird calls and use deep learning to identify which bird it is, based on the Cornell Birdcall Identification Kaggle Challenge where we’ve got a silver medal. . How to deal with the data? . In the previous post our team wrote, we explained how to load sound data and get it to a spectrogram format and why it is crucial. Here’s an example of a spectrogram of birdcalls of Alder Flycatcher and a photo of such a bird, just in case you are curious. . . Fig 3. log mel spectrogram of birdcall, Alder Flycatcher The speed of data processing is one of the keys to utilizing a deep learning model. Although the increment of computation power, the computation cost of audio processing is still expensive on CPUs. However, if we choose a better computation resource to process the data like GPUs, it can boost the speed of about ten to one hundred times faster! In this post, we will show how to process Spectrogram fast by utilizing a library called torchlibrosa that enables us to process Spectrogram on a GPU. . Build Spectrogram processor . torchlibrosa is a Python library that has some audio processing functions implemented in PyTorch that can utilize GPU resources. PyTorch enables running this Spectrogram algorithm on a GPU. Here&#39;s an example of extracting Spectrogram features using torchlibrosa. . from torchlibrosa.stft import Spectrogram spectrogram_extractor = Spectrogram( win_length=1024, hop_length=320 ).cuda() . Load audio data . We can load audio data via librosa library, which is one of the popular Python audio processing libraries. . import librosa # get raw audio data example, _ = librosa.load(&#39;img-kim/example.wav&#39;, sr=32000, mono=True) . Process Spectrogram . import torch raw_audio = torch.Tensor(example).unsqueeze(0).cuda() spectrogram = spectrogram_extractor(raw_audio) . Benchmark processing speed . We can process audio data on the GPU by using torchlibrosa library. You may wonder how much faster on the GPU than the CPU. Here&#39;s the speed of processing the benchmark between the devices. We just selected audio from the dataset obtained from the Cornell Birdcall Identification Kaggle Challenge, which is publicly available, and compared how long it takes on CPU and GPU. We tested on the Colab environment to reproduce the performance, and it is about x15 faster on GPU than CPU to process log-mel spectrogram from about 5 minutes audio. . . Fig 4. Processing time between CPU (Intel Xeon 2.20 GHz) and GPU (Nvidia T4). librosa is used for CPU benchmark, torchlibrosa is used for GPU benchmark How to classify a sound? . As mentioned above, deep learning also shows a brilliant performance in the audio domain. It can catch various patterns of target classes nicely in the time-series data. The more important thing is the environment and data matter in bird calls. The environments like fields or the middle of the mountains, there are lots of noises interfering with the birdcalls. There are lots of birds that can exist in long recorded audio. So considering these cases, we need to build a noise-robust, multi-label audio classifier. . We are going to introduce a deep learning architecture used by our team (Dragonsong) in Cornell Bird Call Identification Kaggle Challenge. . Architecture . We built a novel audio classifier architecture that catches time-series features effectively by utilizing CNN, RNN and attention modules. Here is our brief plot of architecture used at the Cornell Birdcall Identification Challenge. . . Fig 5. Our architecture of birdcall classifier We process a raw audio with a log-mel spectrogram as an input of our architecture, and it passes through the ResNeSt50 backbone, which is one of the image classification architectures. Then, we take the features, which contain both spatial and temporal information, to the RoI (Region of Interest) pooling and bi-GRU layers. In the layers, it catches the time-wise information again while reducing the feature dimension because we thought of extracting temporal features are crucial to classify lots of bird calls in long audio. Lastly, we pass the information into the attention module to score by each time step to find out which time step the birds exist. . Training the model . Not only building deep learning architecture to represent the data but also how to train the model is crucial (a.k.a training recipe). To classify audios that contain multiple bird calls in a noisy environment, we mix multiple bird calls into audio and noises like white noise. Also, regarding lots of variation of bird calls, we augment time and pitch and mask some audio frames by using SpecAugment. Here is a short example of what we applied augmentations. . import IPython.display as ipd ipd.Audio(&#39;img-kim/mixed.wav&#39;) . Your browser does not support the audio element. Fig 6. Augmented sample. The mixed version of Alder Flycatcher and American Avocet. As a result, we can achieve an outperform score on the Kaggle challenge. . Summary . Have you ever woken up without understanding what it was, but knowing for sure that some sound isn&#39;t right? With good algorithms, machines will be able to identify what it was and help you sleep better. Stay tuned! .",

            "content": "Introduction . Close your eyes and listen to the sound around you. No matter whether you are in a crowded office, cozy home, or open space of nature, you can distinguish the environment with sound around you. One of the five major senses of humans is hearing, so audio plays a significant role in our life. Therefore, being able to organize and exploit values in audio data with deep learning is a crucial process for AI to understand our world. An important task in sound processing is enabling computers to distinguish one sound from another. This capability enables computers to do things ranging from detecting metal wearing in power plants to monitoring and optimizing fuel efficiency of cars. In this post, we will use bird sound identification as an example. We will detect locations of bird calls in recordings produced in natural settings and classify species. By converting audio data to image data and applying computer vision models, we acquired a silver medal (top 2%) in Kaggle Cornell Birdcall Identification challenge. . Treating Audios as Images . When a doctor diagnoses heart problems, he can either directly listen to the patient’s heartbeat or look at the ECG, a diagram that describes the heartbeat, of the patient. The former usually takes longer - it takes time for the doctor to listen - and harder - memorizing what you heard can be hard. In contrast, visual perceptions of ECG allows a doctor to absorb spatial information instantly and accelerates the tasks. . The same rationales apply to our sound detection tasks. Here are four audio clips and corresponding spectrograms of four bird species. Even human eyes can see the differences between species instantly based on color and shapes. . . import IPython.display as ipd ipd.Audio(&#39;img-tony/amered.wav&#39;) . Your browser does not support the audio element. ipd.Audio(&#39;img-tony/cangoo.wav&#39;) . Your browser does not support the audio element. ipd.Audio(&#39;img-tony/haiwoo.wav&#39;) . Your browser does not support the audio element. ipd.Audio(&#39;img-tony/pingro.wav&#39;) . Your browser does not support the audio element. Going over the audio waves through time takes more computational resources, and we can acquire more information from the 2-dimensional data of images than 1-dimensional waves. In addition, the recent rapid development of computer visions, especially with the help of Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), can significantly benefit our approach if treating audios as images as we (along with pretty much everyone) did in the competition. . Understanding Spectrogram . The specific image representation that we use is called a spectrogram: a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. . Sounds can be represented in the forms of waves, and waves have two important properties: frequency and amplitude as illustrated in the picture below. The frequency determines how the audio sounds like, and amplitude determines how loud the sound is. . . In a spectrogram of an audio clip, the horizontal direction represents time, and the vertical direction represents different frequencies. Finally, the amplitude of sounds of a particular frequency exists at a particular point of time is represented by the color of the point, resulting from the corresponding x-y coordinates. . . To more intuitively see how frequencies are embodied in spectrograms, here’s a 3D visualization, which demonstrates the amplitude with an extra dimension. Again, the x-axis is time, and y-axis is the value of frequencies. The z-axis is the amplitude of sounds of the frequency of y-coordinate at the moment of the x-coordinate. As the z-value increases, the color changes from blue to red, which results in the color we saw in the previous example of a 2D spectrogram. . . Spectrograms are helpful because they extract exactly the information we need: frequencies, the features that shape the form of sound we hear. Different bird species, or actually all objects that produce sound, have their own unique frequency range so that their sounds appear to be different for our ears. Our model will simply need to master distinguishing between frequencies to achieve ideal classification results. . Mel Scale and Mel Scale Spectrogram . However, human ears do not perceive differences in all frequency ranges equally. As frequencies increase, it is more difficult for us to distinguish between different frequencies. In order to better emulate human ear behaviors with deep learning models, we measure frequencies in mel scale. In the mel scale, any equal distance between frequencies sound equally different for human ears. mel scale converts frequency from in Hertz (f) to in mel (m) with the following equation: . . A mel scale spectrogram is simply a spectrogram with frequencies measured in mel. . How do We Use Spectrogram? . To create a mel spectrogram from audio waves, we will employ librosa library. . import librosa import numpy as np y, sr = librosa.load(&#39;img-tony/amered.wav&#39;, sr=32000, mono=True) melspec = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y, sr=sr, n_mels = 128) melspec = librosa.power_to_db(melspec).astype(np.float32) . Where y denotes the raw wave data, sr denotes sample rate of the audio sample, and n_mels decides the number of mel bands in the generated spectrogram. When using melspectrogram method, you can also set f_min and f_max method You can also set Then, we can convert mel spectrogram that express amplitude in amplitude squared scale to decibel scale with the power_to_db method. . To visualize the generated spectrogram, run . import librosa.display librosa.display.specshow(melspec, x_axis=&#39;time&#39;, y_axis=&#39;mel&#39;, sr=sr, fmax=16000) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f49d0022b90&gt; . Alternatively, if you are using GPU, you can accelerate the mel spectrogram generation process with torchlibrosa library. . is_gpu = False #For demonstration purpose, is_gpu is set to False. Change is_gpu to True when using torchlibrosa. if is_gpu: from torchlibrosa.stft import Spectrogram, LogmelFilterBank spectrogram_extractor = Spectrogram() logmel_extractor = LogmelFilterBank() y = spectrogram_extractor(y) y = self.logmel_extractor(y) . Summary . In conclusion,we can take advantages from recent developments in computer vision in audio-related tasks by converting audio clips into image data. We achieve so with spectrograms that exhibit frequency, amplitude, and time information of audio data in an image. Using mel scale and mel scale spectrogram helps computers to emulate human hearing behaviors of distinguishing sounds of different frequencies. To generate spectrograms, we could employ librosa library, or torchlibrosa for GPU acceleration, in Python. By treating audio-related tasks in such a way, we are able to establish efficient deep learning models to identify and classify sounds, like how doctors diagnose heart-related diseases with ECG. .",

            "title": "Organizational performance explained with Game of Thrones",
            "content": "KPI, OKR, MBO, etc. Managers seem to like 3-letter abbreviations. Let&#39;s make them easy to remember. So, what is a Key Performance Indicator (KPI)? KPI&#39;s have been here for ages, and they are just about setting up quantifiable parameters and measuring those. It can be used as objectives for organization units or team members. What parameter can be measured when we look at the Battle of the Blackwater (from the side of King&#39;s Landing - Cersei seems profound in management techniques)? If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, I suggest you close the article right here - otherwise, read on. So let&#39;s look first at the parameter she is interested in - it is the percentage of Stannis Baratheon ships destroyed by the wildfire. It is an essential parameter for the protecting army in King&#39;s Landing. And it is nicely cascaded downwards. The group target is set (while the outcome is slightly lower). . . Can this one be a Key Performance Indicator for your organization? Unless you run such battles on a recurrent basic (and they didn&#39;t do that even in Seven Kingdoms) - I would not refer to it as a KPI. You would like to use KPIs to monitor organization performance and improve it over periods, and this one is a unique project. You can have Project KPIs, but I suggest sticking with the name Project Metrics. Advanced reader note - terms you use do not matter. You can have project KPIs in your organization. What matters is that you don&#39;t confuse different management tools and use them only for what they are. Project Metrics are parameters set on a project level, measured throughout its execution, and reviewed at project retrospective or lessons learned. . Let&#39;s move to the North and set some KPIs for Night Watch. Quickly for those who&#39;ve forgotten: there are Seven Kingdoms, and the Wall built 8000 years ago. North or the Wall, there are bad things - wildling, giants, White Walkers maybe. The Night Watch aims to guard the Wall to keep the wildlings and White Walkers from crossing into the Seven Kingdoms. So, what can we measure: . . Is this a set of KPIs for the Night Watch organization? It can be. . Do organizations need KPIs? Yes, especially the bigger ones. The larger organization is, the more it will get focused on KPIs. How do you get your KPIs? You know your department goal: Consultancy unit aims to generate Profit by delivering Professional Services, Night Watch aims to kill wildling and White Walkers. Then you set up a measurement system to capture this performance and cascade it—pure, straightforward, top-down. . Now, you are a Lord Commander sitting in Castle Black, and you need to cascade the KPIs we&#39;ve mentioned above. Are they good ones? Think of them for a second. How will you measure it and make it transparent? You are a new generation Lord Commander and set up bonuses for your Leadership Team and the Watch&#39;s members. The Oath is &quot;I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post...&quot; but nothing about &quot;I shall take no performance-based yearly bonus.&quot; Can you set up a yearly bonus based on the parameters above and reflect your leaders&#39; performance? Let&#39;s focus on Rangers first (they fight, defend the Wall, and patrol the Haunted Forest). Well, if you just take numbers above, every leader gets the same KPI (because those are measured globally). Moreover, how do you know how many White Walkers are out there? Adjustment required. . You get some ale, think, and develop a KPI cascade. You end up with individual KPIs like: . . The second KPI is loosely aligned with the organizational objective, and that&#39;s what typically happens in organizations. Leadership KPIs are based on their team averages (e.g., 60% of bonus) and organization KPIs (40% of bonus then). So, years pass, and your team knows that their yearly bonus depends on those KPIs. You get different types of performers. Some truly follow your Vision Statement (&quot;I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.&quot;), but most do not. For those, you observe two behaviors (or a combination of both). Some rangers will go to patrol, take some ale (should we prohibit it during working hours?), and camp a few miles outside. They get patrol KPIs high, and Leadership closes its eyes on that - because their bonus goes up as well. Some will want to be heroes and go kill wildlings in crazy numbers, doing a lot of overtime (that&#39;s not what you&#39;ve wanted, but it helps to promote the company image and hire recruits). Some will raid into the North, kill villagers and present them as wildlings. If you find out, you classify it as not-compliance and apply sanctions (up to execution). . And such an organization works well as long as times are not too turbulent. How? Your individual KPIs are loosely aligned to the organization&#39;s objective, but they are somewhat aligned. There are a lot of camps around (you cap performance component at 200% percent, so it makes sense to patrol a lot), so you are likely to spot a White Walker. Wildlings go deeper into the woods and thus are not trying to cross the Wall either. In a more volatile environment, when you need to innovate because of changing business settings, your organization appears less efficient. . Peter Drucker, in his 1954 book The Practice of Management, proposed an approach called Management by Objectives (MBO). You&#39;re a Lord Commander, and you have not read that, but Maester referred you to something similar from a thousand years back. You don&#39;t want to rely solely on KPIs in appraisals (as too many members seem to do nearly nothing valuable and still get to 100%). You want to reward performance based on objectives that every sworn brother agrees to individually - so make this process more tailor-made. . You split your brotherhood into the Rangers, the Builders, and the Stewards with 3 Leaders (First Ranger, First Builder, and First Steward). You&#39;ve seen giants yourself, and they are enormous. So you talk to the First Builder and agree on specific objectives: . . Such objectives allow the Leadership team to cascade it further in a way that is tailored to their groups or team members, each having their strengths and weaknesses. You no longer set up the same KPIs within a unit, but you align on every individual&#39;s objective on a yearly meeting. Now you are even more competent Lord Commander - you Manage by Objectives. Brothers define objectives together with their leaders aligned with their skills and interests, and your organization grows. First Ranger also takes a more tailor-made set of objectives: . . What&#39;s the issue now? Well, typically, your Objectives are defined between a team member and his boss and are not shared around (exceptions possible), and you set them in a way that reaching 100% is possible with reasonable effort. But the White Walkers have been spotted, and you have no clue how to kill those guys. . You are in an even more volatile environment - you probably have to innovate now, and what you need is Objectives and Key Results (OKR). The concept was introduced by Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel, in the early 1980s. OKRs were popularized by Google using them from the beginning (you have no clue who Andrew Grove is, probably a wise Maester from the past). OKRs are similar to Objectives you used to set up before, with few key differences: . OKRs are transparent (everyone can see all OKRs) | OKRs are set to be challenging (so reaching 100% or all of them is hard) - 70% is already good | OKRs are reviewed more often (quarterly) | OKRs specify not only &quot;what&quot; (Objective) but also &quot;how&quot; (Key Result) | OKRs are not linked to compensation (Bullshit statement - indeed your boss knows how you are doing, so they may not be linked directly, but your package depends on how well you perform on OKRs) You could do everything from above within the MBO framework and never mention an OKR. OKR is a specific way to set up objectives and some adjustments to a technique, not something to replace Management by Objectives entirely. | . Now we are talking. You Maester gets an OKR for this quarter, and your First Ranger also gets one. . . Those are not that easily reachable and will put quite some challenges. In most organizations, you get OKRs where a percentage of completion can be measured, but you can also get a list of more qualitative ones. So now, you can handle innovation better, and your organization strives to grow from inside. Just don&#39;t forget your Vision Statement &quot;I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.&quot; .

            "content": "Introduction . You’re a boss now. You have a team or a business unit doing consultancy. Probably a bunch of Consultants helping clients, some Project Managers leading your projects in a nice Agile or whatever way. Everyone fills their timesheets (and you cut their bonuses if they don’t) – the time is billed to clients, and you have Fixed Fee projects as well. Maybe smaller teams being parts of your organization also – you can lead ten, a hundred or a thousand people (hey, dude – you run a unit of 1000 employees? Don’t read this article – hire someone who did). You probably even have an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) or something and a CFO in a lovely corner office. Do you have an excellent way to estimate how much profit every team member and project brings and ways to predict it with reasonable precision? If you have a decent ERP dashboard which gives you all that – then you’re lucky, and you don’t need this article either. The chances are that you get a simple calculation end of the year – like “let’s take all revenue finance recognized on your projects in a year and man day cost at USD 800 to get your unit profitability”. USD 800 can seem crazily high or unacceptably low, depending on the business you’re in. So that’s the precision you have to count the money your team brings to the firm? Do we need to remind you that this is one of the reasons why your job exists? . What else can you get? All the timesheets projects with their budgets, and you can even get to approximate costs (let’s discuss it later) — a shitload of data for a year, even for a team of 10. What we show is that you don’t need an ERP to do the rest – the notebook in Jupyter will do. Keep this in mind - management starts with measurement. How can you supervise your team and projects if you don’t have their data at your fingers? . Why do you need Data Science here? Well, you can have all data at your fingers. Eventually, you would want to calculate your profit like . profit = revenue - cost . Not only as subtracting two numbers, but also on the level of tables - so the output of the above statement can be a table with profit per consultant per month, like this: . profit . 2020-02 2020-03 . CATHY THE NEW MANAGER 6187.50 | 8006.25 | . FRANK THE CONSTULANT 8050.00 | 3762.50 | .

The code above is indeed not executable, but we promise to get you there in a few paragraphs. And yes, there is some learning of python required. The huge difference from anything else you’ve been doing yourself (ERP reports, Excel, other tools) is that any analysis stays in the notebook and can be re-applied after your data changes. . Data Science . So, let’s get this done. First – yes, you need to know a bit of python to get the files in. The basic level will do. If you are a manager in 2020 and can’t write a simple script – hmm, you probably missed something. The objective is not to build an ERP and not even to have an easy-to-use toolkit - we want to show you how to make a toolkit for yourself (but feel free to reuse our code). What you will see is a straightforward set of examples - spend an hour or two to load your files into the notebook and then start playing with it - just make the analysis you want. You can end up checking a few numbers or building your charts and dashboards. It is ok, even if you work for a corporation (that’s where you need it most) - just install Anaconda and download the notebook. So, we first get and transform our input files (if you want to follow text AND all the code - read it on colab). . We are loading projects, timesheets, and roles below - more details will follow on what we presumed is inside. Note - files are loaded from the GitHub repository so that they will open in colab or your local machine just the same. . data = {} data_path = &#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h17/fastreport/master/data/&#39; url = data_path + &#39;roles.csv&#39; data[&#39;roles&#39;] = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=0, sep=&quot;;&quot;) url = data_path + &#39;project_data.xlsm&#39; project_data = pd.ExcelFile(url) project_data.sheet_names . [&#39;TS Feb&#39;, &#39;TS Mar&#39;, &#39;TS Apr&#39;, &#39;Projects&#39;, &#39;Employees&#39;] . Don’t focus too much on the next code block - we have monthly timesheets in separate tabs and need to stack them one on top of another. Plus - we have errors in excel (Sat.1 column) - data cleanup is also required, quite usual for those who touched data science. Collapsed blocks in our notebook contain the code, which is not critical for understanding. If you’d rather read it all, we suggest you switch to either GitHub or colab, so you can also play with it. . # collapse timesheets = [] for sheet in project_data.sheet_names: if &#39;TS&#39; in sheet: timesheets += [pd.read_excel(project_data, sheet, header=2)] else: tmp = pd.read_excel(project_data, sheet) data[sheet] = tmp if &#39;Sat.1&#39; in timesheets[0]: # cleaning from Sat.1 timesheets[0] = timesheets[0].rename( columns={&#39;Sat&#39;: &#39;Sun&#39;, &#39;Sat.1&#39;: &#39;Sat&#39;}) data[&#39;timesheet&#39;] = pd.concat(timesheets, sort=False) d = {&#39;Billable&#39;: True, &#39;Non-Billable&#39;: False} data[&#39;timesheet&#39;][&#39;Billable&#39;] = data[&#39;timesheet&#39;][&#39;Billing&#39;].replace(d) data[&#39;timesheet&#39;].drop([&#39;Billing&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) data[&#39;timesheet&#39;] = data[&#39;timesheet&#39;][~data[&#39;timesheet&#39;].User.isnull()] . . So, let&#39;s see what we&#39;ve got here: . data.keys() for key in data.keys(): string_format = &quot;{:20} shape: {:&gt;10} rows t and {:&gt;10} columns&quot; print(string_format.format(key, *data[key].shape)) . dict_keys([&#39;roles&#39;, &#39;Projects&#39;, &#39;Employees&#39;, &#39;timesheet&#39;]) . roles shape: 8 rows and 4 columns Projects shape: 48 rows and 10 columns Employees shape: 35 rows and 5 columns timesheet shape: 1792 rows and 14 columns .

EXT users here are outside of our headcount (let’s say we are not getting the real names, but rather some ids from ERP in such case) . Why not just have things done by ERP? Your ERP probably does not present you anything nicely in terms of parameters you’d want to control on your level (otherwise, you won’t read this anyway). There may be a project running to improve it by 2025 - maybe one of the Big4 firms is interviewing you for requirements. If you are steering this boat long enough – you might have ended up with quick and dirty calculation, SQL queries to SAP (with field names still in German), or an Excel file. Why? Your bosses don’t care – they already hired you, and a better ERP is coming in 2025 anyway. So they want to know how much money your team makes (preferably - per person, per month, per project, with charts, projections, and comparisons) and to know why it is not so profitable (because it never is). . To simplify your way forward we are going to create a timeseries out of timesheets which is a bit more involved so you can skip it for now and come back to it later, but the point is that at the end you will get a lovely monthly pandas DataFrame that looks like this . # collapse dd = [] timesheet[&#39;Period Starting&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(timesheet[&#39;Period Starting&#39;]) weekdays = [&#39;Sun&#39;, &#39;Mon&#39;, &#39;Tue&#39;, &#39;Wed&#39;, &#39;Thu&#39;, &#39;Fri&#39;, &#39;Sat&#39;] for i, weekday in enumerate(weekdays): columns = [col for col in timesheet if col not in weekdays or col == weekday] tmp = timesheet[columns].copy() tmp = tmp.rename(columns={weekday: &#39;effort&#39;}) tmp[&#39;date&#39;] = tmp[&#39;Period Starting&#39;]+pd.to_timedelta(&#39;{}D&#39;.format(i)) tmp[&#39;weekday&#39;] = weekday tmp = tmp.drop([&#39;Period Starting&#39;, &#39;Total (Days)&#39;], axis=1) dd += [tmp] timeseries = pd.concat(dd, sort=False).sort_values([&#39;User&#39;, &#39;date&#39;]) timeseries = timeseries.reset_index().drop(&#39;index&#39;, axis=1) timeseries[&#39;date&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(timeseries[&#39;date&#39;]).astype(&#39;str&#39;) timeseries[&#39;month&#39;] = timeseries[&#39;date&#39;].str[:7] def isweekend(x): return x in [&#39;Sun&#39;, &#39;Sat&#39;] timeseries[&#39;weekend&#39;] = timeseries[&#39;weekday&#39;].apply(isweekend) timeseries[&#39;workweek&#39;] = ~timeseries[&#39;weekday&#39;].apply(isweekend) timeseries . .

It is common in data science to have one big DataFrame (similar to excel tab or SQL table) that you can group and filter easily. It is helpful because it makes things very easy. . Profitability . Timesheets and project budgets are simplified this way, and you can manipulate them the way you want in a few simple statements. If you studied excel formulas - you could do this also. Now, let’s look at profitability in the most straightforward manner possible. As a manager, we suggest you do that to set benchmarks for your team. So, profit is $$ mbox{Revenue  –  Cost}$$ and we intend to keep it simple. You can implement the calculations you like. . Revenue: Let’s say that for a Time &amp; Material project, you generate as much revenue as you bill (on agreed rate) up to its budget. We are not doing any Fixed Fee recognition formula. Different companies do it differently, and you’ll either need historical data or actual recognized value depending on how you operate. . We also assume that we are interested only by users in our headcount (so we filter out all EXT users). . # revenue calculation for a person for a month # (SUM REV of all timesheet records * corresp project rates) revenue_df = timeseries[[&#39;User&#39;, &#39;Project&#39;, &#39;Billable&#39;, &#39;effort&#39;, &#39;date&#39;, &#39;month&#39;]] revenue_df = revenue_df.merge(projects[[&#39;Project&#39;, &#39;Daily Rate&#39;]], how=&#39;left&#39;, on=&#39;Project&#39;) revenue_df[&#39;Daily Rate&#39;].fillna(default_revenue, inplace=True) revenue_df = revenue_df[(revenue_df[&#39;User&#39;].str[:3] != &#39;EXT&#39;) &amp; (revenue_df[&#39;Billable&#39;])] revenue_df[&#39;daily_revenue&#39;] = revenue_df[&#39;Daily Rate&#39;] * revenue_df[&#39;effort&#39;] revenue = revenue_df.groupby([&#39;User&#39;, &#39;month&#39;])[ &#39;daily_revenue&#39;].sum().unstack().fillna(0) revenue = revenue[revenue.sum(1) &gt; 0] revenue.head() . month 2020-02 2020-03 2020-04 2020-05 .

Cost: Let’s start with the fact that just using the “default cost rate” is not enough - whenever margins are under pressure, you should do better. You might have people working in different countries and of totally different levels. Talk to your finance team and get some estimates from them (or make it together). We’d say they owe you that much if you were appointed to run a team or business unit. We will assume below that you managed to get a few grades per Country (see roles). Costs per individual will be nice to have as well. The beauty of this tool (compared to doing Excel by yourself) is that you can just add it - it will be a few lines of code. Let’s calculate direct cost per month: here we check the cost of effort posted on timesheets, presuming they are full - can check per number of working days in a month also and compare. We are not interested in external resources, so we’ll filter them out again. . # cost calculation for a project # (SUM COST of all timesheet records * corresp cost rates - see roles) cost_df = timeseries[[&#39;User&#39;, &#39;Project&#39;, &#39;effort&#39;, &#39;date&#39;, &#39;month&#39;]] cost_df = cost_df.merge(headcount[[&#39;Name&#39;, &#39;cost&#39;]], how=&#39;left&#39;, left_on=&#39;User&#39;, right_on=&#39;Name&#39;) cost_df = cost_df[cost_df[&#39;User&#39;].str[:3] != &#39;EXT&#39;] cost_df[&#39;daily_cost&#39;] = cost_df[&#39;cost&#39;] * cost_df[&#39;effort&#39;] cost = cost_df.groupby([&#39;User&#39;, &#39;month&#39;])[&#39;daily_cost&#39;].sum() cost = cost.unstack().fillna(0) cost = cost[cost.sum(1) &gt; 0] cost.head() . month 2020-02 2020-03 2020-04 2020-05 .

User TOM THE EXPERT 26.75 JACK THE EXPERT 25.31 PHILIP THE EXPERT 24.88 Name: effort, dtype: float64 . What else? . Now let’s look at how to apply some python and data science techniques (we will get to more details in our next posts) to data you’ve seen above and how to visualize it nicely. . First, let’s take a PM and visualize revenue on his/her projects per month. . %matplotlib inline pm_selected = &quot;CATHY THE NEW MANAGER&quot; drawdt = revenue.loc[pm_selected].T plt.bar(range(len(drawdt.index)), drawdt.values, color=&quot;green&quot;, width=1, align=&#39;center&#39;, edgecolor=&#39;black&#39;); plt.xticks(range(len(drawdt.index)), drawdt.index); plt.ylabel(&quot;Revenue / month: &quot;+pm_selected); . That was simple. Then, some fun for those who know slightly more advanced python - you can make an interactive chart in few lines, e.g., here we want to make it visual in terms of if the value is above or below the benchmark (works if you copy notebook, is not clickable on the blog) . # collapse %matplotlib notebook # colors of bars def get_colors(v): colors = [] for i in range(len(drawdt.index)): color = &quot;yellow&quot; if (drawdt[i] &lt; v*0.9): color = &quot;red&quot; if (drawdt[i] &gt; v*1.1): color = &quot;green&quot; colors.append(color) return colors # plot drawing def plt_all(isdef, yvalue): if isdef: bcolors = &quot;white&quot; xtitle = &#39;Set value&#39; else: a = np.empty(len(drawdt.index)) a.fill(yvalue) plt.plot(range(len(drawdt.index)), a, color=&quot;black&quot;, alpha=0.5) bcolors = get_colors(yvalue) xtitle = &#39;At ${:.0f}/m is&#39;.format(yvalue) plt.bar(range(len(drawdt.index)), drawdt.values, color=bcolors, width=1, align=&#39;center&#39;, edgecolor=&#39;black&#39;) plt.xticks(range(len(drawdt.index)), drawdt.index) plt.ylabel(&quot;Revenue / month: &quot;+pm_selected) red_patch = mpatches.Patch(color=&#39;red&#39;, label=&#39;loss&#39;) yellow_patch = mpatches.Patch(color=&#39;yellow&#39;, label=&#39;in 10%&#39;) green_patch = mpatches.Patch(color=&#39;green&#39;, label=&#39;profit&#39;) plt.legend(handles=[red_patch, yellow_patch, green_patch], loc=&#39;upper left&#39;, title=xtitle, fontsize=7) plt.gca().set_title(&#39;Click on the plot to set benchmark&#39;) plt_all(True, 0.0) def onclick(event): plt.cla() plt_all(False, event.ydata) plt.gcf().canvas.mpl_connect(&#39;button_press_event&#39;, onclick); . . Ok, as a Team Leader, you might not do that. Sorry. Let’s get some calculations done. First, let’s identify “suspicious” time entered (e.g., a person who has more than three days in a row same effort on a given project and it is not 8 hours) - this is a quick check you do yourself, without asking PMO anything and making this official. I can call this suspicious because nature of our work (and yours might be different - so you look for another pattern) makes it highly unlikely that you do spend the same amount of time on one project a few days in a row (unless you are assigned full time). What you are doing is likely just splitting your working time between your projects in some manner. . # remove the weekend working = timeseries[(timeseries[&#39;workweek&#39;] == True) &amp; (timeseries.Billable)].copy() working = working.groupby([&quot;User&quot;, &quot;Project&quot;, &quot;date&quot;]).sum().sort_index() working[&#39;value_grp&#39;] = (working.effort.diff(1) == 0).astype(&#39;int&#39;) def streak(df): # function that finds streak of 1s: 0,1,1,0,1 -&gt; 0,1,2,0,1 df0 = df != 0 return df0.cumsum()-df0.cumsum().where(~df0).ffill().fillna(0).astype(int) working[&#39;streak&#39;] = streak( working[&#39;value_grp&#39;]) # streak of identical effort result = working[(0 &lt; working.effort) &amp; (working.effort &lt; 1) &amp; (working[&#39;streak&#39;] &gt; 3)].reset_index() result = result[result.User.str[:3] != &#39;EXT&#39;].groupby([&#39;User&#39;, &#39;Project&#39;]).last() result[[&quot;effort&quot;,&quot;date&quot;,&quot;streak&quot;]] . effort date streak .

People will likely change their behaviors, and you might not easily find the next pattern. As a manager, you dig into your data, find insights, and act on them the way you see fit. You do not just tell your teenage kid that now you know where he hides cigarettes, do you? . Use cases . Here are some cases where the above can be helpful - we will look at some of them in our next posts. . Decision-making - e.g. identify top loss-making projects | Identify projects which require management attention - also apply Machine Learning here and identify the projects you&#39;ll pick up yourself | Better analysis of non-billable hours | Identify suspicious behaviors - anomaly detections | Revenue and effort projections based on existing patterns and not highlighting when the plan deviates | Consolidated analytic on demand (e.g. profitability forecast, revenue forecast, unallocated capacity) in case your ERP will not do anything like that | . The point is that loading your data (excel, CSV, TSV - whatever) is simple, and manipulating it is simple - more straightforward than doing it in many excel files and faster than waiting for PMOs. .
