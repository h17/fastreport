Welcome to Data for Teams blog. While travelling from New York to Florida by car in 2019 we've spoken a lot 
and got fascinated by various applications of Data Science to topics it is typically not applied to. So we decided to leverage our experiences and create this blog - we will talk here about
applications to Data Science to Project Management and General Management (on the level of individual teams or business units, not on enterprise level per se)

Thing you used to rely on ERP or your PMO doing a report for you can be made simple with python, pandas and jupyter. In the first post we discuss how you can

1) See an example of how easy it is to do an analytics you can do yourself using timesheets and project files.

2) Play arround with your own data.

3) Create your own hosted dashboards or reports that you can show to your colleagues, subordinates or superiors.
