Welcome to Data for Teams blog. While travelling from New York to Florida by car in 2019 we've spoken a lot 
and got fascinated by various applications of Data Science to topics it is typically not applied to. We thought that data science techinques can be applied not
only by data scientist, but also by practicioners in different industries. Python is fairly simple (if you want to keep doing simple things) - we claim that
whoever mastered in Microsoft Excel or Apple Sheets can get to a decent level of understanding python.
So we decided to leverage our experiences and create this blog - we will talk here about
applications to Data Science to Project Management and General Management (on the level of individual teams or business units, not on enterprise level per se)

Thing you used to rely on ERP or on your PMO doing a report for you can be made simple with python, pandas and jupyter. In the first post you'll

1) See an example of how easy it is to do an analytics yourself using timesheets and project files.

2) Play arround with your own data.

3) Create your own hosted dashboards or reports that you can show to your colleagues, subordinates or superiors.

Does this ring a bell for you and have you been also asking yourself - why do I need all those complex reports to work with simple data? Or do you totally disagree with our view? 
Do send us an email and let's discuss!
