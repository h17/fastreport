    "You’re a boss now. You have a team or a business unit doing consultancy. Probably a bunch of Consultants helping clients, some Project Managers leading your projects in a nice Agile or whatever way. Everyone fills their timesheets (and you cut their bonuses if they don’t) – time is billed to clients and you have Fixed Fee projects also. Maybe smaller teams being parts of your team also – you can lead ten, hundred or thousand people (hey, dude – you run a unit of 1000 employees? Don’t read this article – hire someone who did) You probably even have an ERP or something and a CFO in a nice corner office. Do you have a good way to estimate how much profit every team member and project brings and ways to predict it with good precision? If you have a nice ERP dashboard which gives you all that – then you’re lucky and you don’t need this article either. But high chances are that you get a simple calculation end of year – like “let’s take all revenue finance recognized on your projects in a year and man day cost at USD 800  to get your unit profitability” \n",
    "( USD 800  can seem crazily high or unacceptably low, depending on business you’re in). So that’s the precision you have to count the money your team brings to firm? Do we need to remind you that this is the only reason why your job exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "What else can you get – all the timesheets, projects with their budgets and you can even get to approximate costs (let's discuss it later). Shitload of data for a year even for a team of 10. What I will tell you here is that you don’t need an ERP to do the rest – the notebook in Jupyter will do. Let’s remember - management starts with measurement. How can you supervise your team and projects if you don’t have their data at your fingers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do you need Data Science here? Well, you can have all data at your fingers. Eventually you would want to calculate your profit like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "profit = revenue - cost\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only as subtracting two numbers, but also on the level of tables - so output of above statement can be actualy a table with profit per consultant per month, like this:"

The objective is not to build an ERP and not even to have an easy-to-use toolkit - we want to show you how to build toolkit for yourself (but feel free to reuse our code). hat you will see is a very simple set of examles - spend an hour or two to load your files into the notebook and then start playing with it - just make the analysis you want. You can end up checking a few numbers or building your own charts and dashboards.

Well, your ERP probably does not present you anything nicely in terms of parameters you’d want to control on your level  (otherwise you won’t read this anyway).

If you are steering this boat long enough – you might have ended up with quick and dirty calculation, SQL queries to SAP (with field names still in German) or an Excel file. Why? Because, well, your bosses don’t care – they already hired you and a better ERP is coming in 2025 anyway – so they want to know how much money your team makes (preferably - per person, per month, per project) and to know why is it not so profitable (because it never is).\n",

You might have people working in different countries and of totally different levels. Talk to your finance team and get some estimates from them (or make it together). We’d say if you were appointed to run a team or business unit – they owe you that much. We will assume below that you managed to get few grades per Country (see _roles_).  Costs per individual will go nicely also and the beauty of this tool (compared to doing few excels by yourself) is that you can just add it - for all of your staff or some some, it will be 1 line of code. Let's calculate direct cost per momnth (here we check the cost of effort posted on timesheets, presuming they are full - can check per number of working days in a month also and compare.
