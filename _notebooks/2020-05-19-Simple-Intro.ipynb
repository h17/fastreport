    "You’re the boss now. You have a team or a business unit doing consultancy. Probably a bunch of Consultants helping clients, some Project Managers leading your projects in a nice Agile or whatever way. Everyone fills their timesheets (and you cut their bonuses if they don’t) – time is billed to clients and you have Fixed Fee projects also. Maybe smaller teams being parts of your team also – you can lead ten, hundred or thousand people (hey, dude – you run a unit of 1000 employees? Don’t read this article – hire someone who did) You probably even have an ERP or something and a CFO in a nice corner office. Do you have a good way to estimate how much profit every team member and project brings and ways to predict it with good precision? If you have a nice ERP dashboard which gives you all then – then you’re lucky and you don’t need this article either. But 70% chances are [a reference to research would be nice - trello] that you get a simple calculation end of year – like “let’s take all revenue finance recognized on your projects in a year and man day cost at $800 to get your unit profitability” ($800 can seem crazily high or unacceptably low, depending on business you’re in). So that’s the precision you have to the money your team brings to firm? Do we need to remind you that this is the only reason why your job exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "What you probably have is – all the timesheets, projects with their budget and you can even get to approximate costs nicely (we’ll get there). Shitload of data for a year even for a team of 10. What I will tell you here is that you don’t need an ERP to do the rest – the notebook in Jupyter will do for now. Let’s remember - management starts with measurement. How can you supervise your team and projects if you don’t have their data at your fingers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do you need Data Science here? Well, you can have all data an your fingers. Let me show you 3 Project Managers which have highest profit margin from beginning of the year - based on timesheets, revenue type and cost rates in one (not-so-simple) line"

    "So, let’s get this done. First – yes, you need to know a little bit of python to get the files in. Basic level will do. (If you are a manager in 2020 and can’t write a simple script – hm, you probably missed something). The objective is to have an easy-to-use toolkit. We are definitely not developing any ERP here. What you will see is a very simple set of tools - you spend an hour or two to load your files into the notebook and then start playing with it - just make the analysis you want. You can end up checking a few numbers or building your own charts and dashboards. It is all under L-GPL - free to use, even if you work for a corporation (that’s where you need it most) - just install Anaconda and download the notebook. \n",
