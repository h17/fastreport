    "Data encoding is the crucial part of any data science pipeline. No matter what is the final goal or which machine learning algorithm will be used - there is no avoiding of data massaging, cleaning, and encoding. Given that real data sets are rarely as clean and suited for analysis as toy data sets from data science classes, there is a number of decisions you have to make to encode and engineer features in the most appropriate and efficient way.\n",
    "While the encoding of quantitative and binary columns is generally straightforward, the encoding of categorical variables deserves a deeper look. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "One of the most popular encoding methods for categorical variables has been the One-Hot procedure. It generates an indicator variable for every category and, thus, creates a set of K new features, where K is the number of categories.\n",
    "One significant implication of this method is the dimensionality increase. Depending on the magnitude of K, it can have various undesirable technical consequences: substantial raise of computational complexity, loss of degrees of freedom (N-K, where N is the number of samples), multicollinearity, and, ultimately, an overfitted model. Non-technical consequences include unnecessary complication of the model that should be communicated to final users and that contradict the law of parsimony, also known as Occam's razor."

    "Instead of One-Hot, we propose an alternative way to encode categorical variables. Imagine that instead of K features you would make only one. The trick is to treat categorical variables as quantitative and find a certain way to order categories. "

    ">Important note here: this method is highly efficient in conjunction with the models that rely on variables as ranks rather than exact values. For example, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting - these algorithms will output the same result if the variable *Number of Children* is coded as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...] or as [-100, -85, 0, 10, 44, ...] as long as the categories have a correct order, and we use correct interpretation of non-meaningful values.\n",
    "The application of our method for other algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression is out of scope of this article. We expect that such way of feature engineering would be still beneficial, but this is a subject of a different investigation."

While **quantitative** variables have a *ratio* scale, i.e. they have a meaningful 0, ordered values, and equal distances between values; **categorical** variables usually have either *interval*, or *ordinal*, or *nominal* scales.\n",

    "In a straightforward way, if we simply use the raw values 1 through 5, that will save us dimensionality without losing a single bit of information. Indeed, the algorithm such as *xgboost* will make splits on this scale to introduce a new node any number of times it finds the best, instead of being forced to use the splits predetermined by One-Hot. With a large K, the algorithm would be forced into using big number of predermined splits which might be simply an overfit."
