    "You’re a boss now. You have a team or a business unit doing consultancy. Probably a bunch of Consultants helping clients, some Project Managers leading your projects in a nice Agile or whatever way. Everyone fills their timesheets (and you cut their bonuses if they don’t) – the time is billed to clients, and you have Fixed Fee projects as well. Maybe smaller teams being parts of your organization also – you can lead ten, a hundred or a thousand people (hey, dude – you run a unit of 1000 employees? Don’t read this article – hire someone who did). You probably even have an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) or something and a CFO in a lovely corner office. Do you have an excellent way to estimate how much profit every team member and project brings and ways to predict it with reasonable precision? If you have a decent ERP dashboard which gives you all that – then you’re lucky, and you don’t need this article either. The chances are that you get a simple calculation end of the year – like “let’s take all revenue finance recognized on your projects in a year and man day cost at USD 800 to get your unit profitability”. USD 800 can seem crazily high or unacceptably low, depending on the business you’re in. So that’s the precision you have to count the money your team brings to the firm? Do we need to remind you that this is one of the reasons why your job exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "What else can you get? All the timesheets projects with their budgets, and you can even get to approximate costs (let’s discuss it later) — a shitload of data for a year, even for a team of 10. What we show is that you don’t need an ERP to do the rest – the notebook in Jupyter will do. Keep this in mind - management starts with measurement. How can you supervise your team and projects if you don’t have their data at your fingers?\n",

    "Ok, as a Team Leader, you might not do that. Sorry. Let’s get some calculations done. First, let’s identify “suspicious” time entered (e.g., a person who has more than three days in a row same effort on a given project and it is not 8 hours) - this is a quick check you do yourself, without asking PMO anything and making this official. I can call this suspicious because nature of our work (and yours might be different - so you look for another pattern) makes it highly unlikely that you do spend the same amount of time on one project a few days in a row (unless you are assigned full time). What you are doing is likely just splitting your working time between your projects in some manner."
